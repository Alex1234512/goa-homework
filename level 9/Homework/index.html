    <h1>Information about 5 programming languages</h1>

    <p><b>1) PYTHON</b></p>
    <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by <b> Guido van Rossum</b> in 1991 and developed by <b> Python Software Foundation</b>.
        It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
        Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many <b> non-programmers</b> such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances. The answer to the question "in which language python is written?" is - Python written in the <b> C programming language</b>. It means that the Python interpreter is written in C. <b> CPython</b> is that Python implementation that is done in the C language. CPython supports a wide range of libraries and modules.</p>

    <p><b>2) HTML</b></p>
    <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at <b> CERN</b>, proposed and prototyped <b> ENQUIRE</b>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, <b> Berners-Lee</b> wrote a memo proposing an <b> Internet-based hypertext system</b>. Berners-Lee specified <b> HTML</b> and wrote the browser and server software in late <b> 1990</b>. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. Writing HTML code is a matter of understanding HTML tags. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets, each comprising an opening and closing part. They function as building blocks that define the structure of your web page. Think of them as the bricks and mortar of web development.</p>
    
    <p><b>3) JavaScript</b></p>
    <p><b>JavaScript</b> was invented by <b> Brendan Eich</b> in <b> 1995</b>. It was developed for <b> Netscape 2</b>, and became the <b> ECMA-262</b> standard in <b> 1997</b>. After <b> Netscape</b> handed JavaScript over to <b> ECMA</b>, the <b> Mozilla foundation</b> continued to develop JavaScript for the <b> Firefox</b> browser. JavaScript is a scripting language used <b> to develop web pages</b>. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page. So, to answer the question "What is JavaScript written in?" â€” <b> JavaScript code itself is written in plain text</b>, but the language was originally developed using C and C++. Modern implementations of JavaScript, like Google's V8 engine, are primarily written in C++.</p>
    
    <p><b>4) C++</b></p>
    <p>C++ was invented by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs in 1979. <b> It originated from analysis of the UNIX kernel to investigate to what extent it can be distributed over a network</b>. C++ is used in fields such as <b> system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing and high-performance applications</b>. The C++ standard library provides a range of coding utilities and functions, making it easy to develop complex software systems. C++ is a high-level programming language and it is written in <b> C programming language or assembly language</b>. Most of the modern compilers for C++ are written in C++, it means the compilers are implemented using C++ language. 'C++ is written in C++. '</p>
